      <h3>Welcome to the Rose Garden.  This is where I make all my blog posts.
      This is also where I will ask other people, men and women who have helped
      me to grow in Christ, to write their own articles.<br>
      I read a book once about a man who had a magnificent labrynthian garden with
      many different kinds of flowers.  I think a rose labrynth would be lovely
      with little signs and benches and vintage lamp posts, don't you?  There is a
      bench here where you can sit and read a while if you like.  It's good to stop
      and smell the roses.</h3>
