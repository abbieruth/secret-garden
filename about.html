      <h1>How the garden came to be</h1>
      <p>I believe everyone has a purpose in life and it is our duty to discover and fulfill that purpose before
our life is over, whether that purpose is to stop or start a war, find a cure for cancer, or simply
encourage someone who needs it, or maybe just smile at someone.
  I read a story once about a man who jumped off a bridge and killed himself.  When they found his suicide note,
it read, "If one person smiles at me on the way to the bridge, I won't jump."  That story has stuck with me ever
since.  Maybe I'm not supposed to accomplish great things; maybe I'm just supposed to smile at someone so they won't
jump, and then they'll go on to do great things.  I think everyone's purpose in life is equally
important, whether it seems great or small to the rest of the world.  But no matter how insignificant
it may seem, the tiniest action can cause unimaginable results.  Maybe we won't get to know those
results until after we die; maybe we won't even know if we've fulfilled our purpose until then.  But
regardless, we are all here for a reason.
  I feel like time is running short and I have yet to discover what my purpose is.  I feel like,
whatever it is I'm supposed to do, big or small, I haven't done it yet.  It's a scary feeling.  I want
to help people, but I don't know how I'm supposed to do it or who I'm supposed to help.  So I'm
starting this website.  I'm going to be posting things that have helped me and other people through
hard times.  I want to try to provide encouragment and advice to anyone who needs it.  Lord knows I've
needed it often enough.
  Maybe my only purpose in life is to smile at the right person or to say whatever it is they need to
hear at that moment.  Whatever my purpose is, I'm going to keep smiling, praying, encouraging, and
helping people, whenever and wherever I can, until God takes me home.  God has saved many people's
lives before, and I believe if I'm faithful to serve Him and pray for His guidance, He will show me
what it is I'm supposed to do and help me do it before I leave this world.
  Yikes!  The way I'm talking, you'd think I had cancer or something.  Although that kind of thing does
run in my family, the most fatal condition I have right now is common human mortality.  I'm not dying
any faster than your average teenager, but I know time is short.  I've wasted enough of it already.
I'm afraid to waste any more.
  I will be posting as often as God gives me something and as regularly as I can.  I hope this blog
reaches someone who needs it.  I pray God will work through me and this website to help people I will
never have the privilege to meet.  I hope I can help you.
  Goodnight! <br>
