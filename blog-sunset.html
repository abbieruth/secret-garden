      <h3>
        Welcome to the Rose Garden.  This is where I make all my blog posts.
      This is also where I will ask other people, men and women who have helped
      me to grow in Christ, to write their own articles.<br>
      I read a book once about a man who had a magnificent labrynthian garden with
      many different kinds of flowers.  I think a rose labrynth would be lovely
      with little signs and benches and vintage lamp posts, don't you?  There is a
      bench here where you can sit and read a while if you like.  It's good to stop
      and smell the roses.

        <h4>Sunset</h4>
        <p>
            <span class="reference">Psalm 65:8</span>
            <span class="quote">
                "They also that dwell in the uttermost parts are afraid at thy tokens: 
                thou makest the outgoings of the morning and evening to rejoice."
            </span>
        </p>
        <p>
            Some people describe a sunset as a dying day. It certainly appeals to our dramatic side 
            and has something of a majestic flair when compared with the mythical phoenix. But in the end, 
            they are still comparing one of the most beautiful sights in this world to death, a word 
            we associate with gloomy colors and sadness. Yes, there is death in a sunset, but there is also 
            hope and joy. There's hope of the day that will follow the coming night, and joy in that hope.
        </p>
        <p>
            When I look at a sunset, I don't see just the death of a day. I see the sun going out in a blaze 
            of glory; dying, yes, but reminding us that it will return again. As the sun sinks beneath the 
            horizon to where we can no longer see it, it paints the sky with its most beautiful and vibrant 
            colors, somehow richer and deeper than those of the sunrise, to remind us that it will return. 
            Even the darkest night, even the cloudiest day, cannot keep the sun's light from us forever. 
            Sooner or later, it will return and we will see it once again.
        </p>
        <p>
            In this, I see an allegory of Christ. <span class="reference">Luke 23:44-46</span> <span class="quote">"And it was about the sixth hour, 
            and there was a darkness over all the earth until the ninth hour. And the sun was darkened, and the veil 
            of the temple was rent in the midst. And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, he said, 
            Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit: and having said thus, he gave up the ghost."</span> 
            When He gave His life for us, the whole sky darkened prematurely. It became as night while 
            the day had several hours left, as if to signify that the Light of this world had passed from it 
            for a time. And yet neither Death nor Hell could hold Him any longer than the three days He had 
            said He would be gone for. <span class="reference">Mark 8:31</span><span class="quote">"And he began to teach them, that the Son of man 
            must suffer many things, and be rejected of the elders, and of the chief priests, and scribes, 
            and be killed, and after three days rise again."</span> Sure enough, Mary and some of the other 
            women who had followed Jesus went to His tomb as the sun was rising on the third day, only to find 
            that the Son of God had already risen from the dead. <span class="reference">Mark 16:2-6</span> <span class="quote">"And very early in the 
            morning the first day of the week, they came unto the sepulchre at the rising of the sun... And 
            when they looked, they saw that the stone was rolled away: for it was very great. And 
            entering into the sepulchre, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, clothed in a long 
            white garment; and they were affrighted. And he saith unto them, Be not affrighted: Ye seek 
            Jesus of Nazareth, which was crucified: he is risen; he is not here: behold the place where they 
            laid him."</span> The Light had returned to the world to lead us out of darkness and into the eternal 
            light of Heaven and fellowship with the Father!
        </p>
        <p>
            Finally, I see a hope for our own deaths. When we lose a loved one, it seems our whole 
            world grows darker for a time. And yet, as in the brilliant colors of the setting sun we find 
            hope that it will rise again, so we find hope that we, too, will rise again as the Word says. 
            <span class="reference">1 Corinthians 15:51-54</span> <span class="quote">"Behold, I shew you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be 
            changed, In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall 
            sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed. For this corruptible 
            must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality. So when this corruptible 
            shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be 
            brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory."</span> Death may hold 
            us longer than it did our Saviour, but he will have to relinquish his hold on us someday 
            and we will be reunited with our loved ones who are saved. Then we will see God and live in 
            the light of His glory forever! There will be no sun and no sunsets in Heaven because there 
            will be no need for them. We will no longer need to be reminded that darkness does not last 
            forever or that death is not permanent because there is no death or darkness in Heaven, no 
            sadness or sin, no fear, no pain, and no suffering.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is the message of hope I see.
        </p>
        <p>
            So what do you see when you look at a sunet? Do you see a herald of the coming night or a 
            promise of the coming light?
