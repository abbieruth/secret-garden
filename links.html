      <h1>The Enchanted Forest</h1>
      <h3>Welcome to the Enchanted Forest.  I always loved walking in the woods,
      but this forest is special.  It has many helpful little paths that will
      transport you to many different places in an instant.  I planted my garden
      at the edge of this forest so I could connect it to other places for people
      to find help, guidance, or rest.  Here I must leave you to continue your
      journey.  I must stay to tend the garden and help others who come to visit.
      I hope you will return to visit me again.  Come as often as you like and we
      can visit together or, if you need some quiet time, feel free to explore the
      garden alone.  Remember, this is God's garden, the Garden of Prayer, and He
      will meet you here or anywhere else if you are looking for Him.  He will walk
      with you all the way, every night and every day.</h3>
